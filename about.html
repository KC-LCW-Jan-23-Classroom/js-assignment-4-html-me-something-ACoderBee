      <h1 id="aboutHeading">Hi, I'm Andrea</h1>
         <p>I'm a baby Boomer. Born and raised in Middle America in a typical middle-class family with 2 parents, a sister, and a dog.  I have a wonderful son whom I raised alone.  I have no grandchildren, yet! </p>
         <p> I had an idyllic childhood. I lived on a dead-end street.   I ran through the woods, built tree houses, swung on ropes like Tarzan, and walked to school and the neighborhood store by myself when I was in kindergarten.</p> 
         <p > However, I have a  brand new car with a brand new car payment. I don't see retirement in my immediate future. I write this as I try to decipher the complexity of Medicare during my Initial Enrollment Period. </p>
      <h2>What I think about the world today         
      </h2>  
         <p>As long as we hide from our problems, keep kicking the can down the road, we are doomed.  Slavery was an active program for 400 years in America.  The practice of slavery in America criminalized reading and writing, allowed the legal rape of women and children, treated human beings as livestock, and slave auction blocks dissolved family units.  Then we had Indian Relocation, Jim Crow, Japanese internment, and now the prison system.  </p> 
         <p>The United States government is accountable for state support injustices to it's citizens within it's jurisdiction and that includes equal protection under the law.  Just as state is accountable so are we personally accountable for our actions.  If you do not work, you will not get paid, and so you will not eat.  There is no such thing as a free ride for the able bodied.  Without self-respect and pride, we are consumed by jealousy and sloth. <a href= "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/transcoded/6/67/Address_Before_a_Joint_Session_of_Congress_%28February_24%2C_2009%29_-_Barack_Obama_%28WhiteHouse.gov%29.ogv/Address_Before_a_Joint_Session_of_Congress_%28February_24%2C_2009%29_-_Barack_Obama_%28WhiteHouse.gov%29.ogv.160p.webm" target="_blank"> All branches of the government are accountable and so are we all.</a>

         <p>Let me tell you what I really think:</p>
