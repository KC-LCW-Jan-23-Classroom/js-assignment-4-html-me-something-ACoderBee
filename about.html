      <h1>Hi I'm Andrea</h1>
         <p>I'm a baby Boomer. Born and raised in Middle America in a typical middle-class family with 2 parents, a sister, and a dog.</p>
         <p> I had an idyllic childhood. I lived on a dead-end street.   I ran through the woods, built tree houses, swung on ropes like Tarzan, and walked to school and the neighborhood store by myself when I was in kindergarten.</p> 
         <p> I have a wonderful son whom I raised alone.  I have no grandchildren, yet! However, I have a  brand new car with a brand new car payment. I don't see retirement in my immediate future.</p>  
         <p>I write this as I try to decipher the complexity of Medicare during my Initial Enrollment Period. </p>
      <h2>What I think about the world today</h2>  
         <p>As long as we hide from our problems, keep kicking the can down the road, we are doomed.  We must be accountable for our actions, if you do not work, you will not get paid.  There is no such thing as a free ride.  Without self-respect and pride, we are consumed by jealousy and sloth. </p> 
         <p> Slavery was an active program for 400 years in America.  The practice of slavery in America criminalized reading and writing, allowed the legal rape of women and children, selling of slaves dissolved family units, and treated human beings as livestock. Jim Crow, prison system, and self-hate the rape continues.
