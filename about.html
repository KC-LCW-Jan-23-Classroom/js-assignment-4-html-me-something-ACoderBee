         <h1>Hi I'm Andrea</h1>
         <p>I'm a baby Boomer. Born and raised in Middle America in a typical middle-class family with 2 parents, a sister, and a dog.</p>
           <p> I had an idyllic childhood. I lived on a dead-end street.   I ran through the woods, built tree houses, swung on ropes like Tarzan, and walked to school and the neighborhood store by myself when I was in kindergarten.</p> 
            <p> I have a wonderful son whom I raised alone.  I have no grandchildren, yet! However, I have a  brand new car with a brand new car payment. I don't see retirement in my immediate future.</p>  
            <p>I write this as I try to decipher the complexity of Medicare during my Initial Enrollment Period. </p>
